# Project Euler in Python

In this repository I collect my solutions to the famous set of mathematical challenges found at https://projecteuler.net.

While I am trying to solve the exercises in ascending order (which mostly resembles ascending difficulty), I will solve some exercises from a later stage without having done some preceding ones.

The exercises are labeled the following: "id_exercise name".

Not all of the exercises will be solved by the most efficient manner, but sometimes just in the most readable way. However, if highest efficiency is key for an exercise, the focus will be put on this.
